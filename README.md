# Project in Molecular Life Science

## Overview
This repository contains the resources for analyzing breast cancer scRNA-seq and ISS transcriptomic data from the Janesick et al. (2023) study.  It includes the notebooks for preprocessing and analyzing scRNA-seq and ISS datasets, training LDA models, and performing differential gene expression (DGE) analysis.

## Data
- Chromium scRNA-seq data, including count matrix, features, and barcodes list are available in the following Google Drive folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14Y6csHwBJ_KGR7pPU6bO8sgFhsNSSfaT?usp=drive_link
- Xenium and Vizgen ISS datasets can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KfcSJUEDn3UJxFnsixnLXUjWTvWy3Ymm?usp=drive_link
- Metadata is available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XHkZ_wsk9y_LQwP4ydhZ5cj7kCtyat9v?usp=drive_link
- Necessary .rds files can be found here (or obtained from the analysis): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UPB5Fgct1HTnDXq8rl1scaiNogfGN5aB?usp=drive_link

## Notebooks
- For scRNA-seq data handling, refer to the script in the scRNA-seq folder.
- For Xenium ISS data handling and scRNA-seq projections, refer to the script in the ISS folder.
- For various LDA applications, refer to the scripts in the LDA folder: LDA_17.rmd for cell type annotations for 17 cell types;
